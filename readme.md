# üÜö What's better, Windows Stock, or Winter?

üîí Privacy,
Winter removes all types of tracking features that are embedded into Stock Windows, we also implemented multiple group policies to minimise data collection. Things outside the scope of Windows we cannot increase the privacy for, such as Websites that you visit on your browser. 

üõ°Ô∏è Security, 
Winter aims to be as secure as possible without losing performance. We do this by disabling mitigations that can leak some of your personal information, or exploit your PC. There are exceptions to this, such as spectre and meltdown, to improve performance. If a security mitigation decreases performance, we will disable that mitigation. As we are focused on performance and Security!
